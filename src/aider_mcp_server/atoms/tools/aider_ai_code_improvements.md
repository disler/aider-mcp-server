# Implemented and Proposed Improvements to aider_ai_code.py

This document outlines changes made to aider_ai_code.py to address issues with empty files and missing API key reporting, as well as proposed future improvements.

## Implemented Improvements

### 1. API Key Status Reporting

We've added improvements to report API key status to users, addressing the issue where files are created empty when necessary API keys are missing:

- Enhanced check_api_keys() to return detailed status information about available/missing providers
- Added API key status information to responses
- Added warnings when API keys for requested providers are missing
- Improved error handling to provide clearer feedback to users
- Files will still be created but users will now see warnings explaining why they might be empty

### 2. Changes Summarization

To address the issue where files are created but the diff is empty or too large, we've made changes to how changes are reported by the aider_ai_code tool:

## Proposed Further Improvements

The key improvements still to be implemented are:

1. Add a new changes_summarizer.py module that can:
   - Parse git diff output or file contents
   - Create a concise, high-level summary of changes
   - Limit context size to reduce token usage
   - Properly detect file creation even when git diff doesn't

2. Modify _process_coder_results to:
   - Include both the full diff (for backward compatibility) and a summary
   - Always set success=true if files were created, even if content is minimal
   - Use filesystem status checks as a fallback when git diff fails

3. Add a file_status_summary function that:
   - Verifies if files were created or modified using OS file operations
   - Provides a reliable way to detect file changes without git

## Implementation Changes

### 1. In _process_coder_results function:

```python
from aider_mcp_server.atoms.tools.changes_summarizer import summarize_changes, get_file_status_summary

async def _process_coder_results(
    relative_editable_files: List[str],
    working_dir: Optional[str] = None,
    use_diff_cache: bool = True,
    clear_cached_for_unchanged: bool = True,
) -> ResponseDict:
    """Process the results after Aider has run..."""
    global diff_cache
    logger.info("Processing coder results...")

    # Initialize diff_cache if it's None and we're using it
    if use_diff_cache and diff_cache is None:
        logger.info("Initializing diff_cache in _process_coder_results")
        await init_diff_cache()

    # Get the raw diff output from git or file contents
    diff_output = get_changes_diff_or_content(relative_editable_files, working_dir)
    logger.info(f"Raw diff output obtained (length: {len(diff_output)}).")

    # Check for meaningful content in the edited files
    logger.info("Checking for meaningful changes in edited files...")
    has_meaningful_content = _check_for_meaningful_changes(relative_editable_files, working_dir)
    logger.info(f"Meaningful content detected: {has_meaningful_content}")

    # Check file status using filesystem operations as a secondary verification
    file_status = get_file_status_summary(relative_editable_files, working_dir)
    logger.info(f"File status summary: {file_status['status_summary']}")

    # Set success based on both checks
    success = has_meaningful_content or file_status["has_changes"]
    logger.info(f"Success determined as {success} (meaningful:{has_meaningful_content}, file_changes:{file_status['has_changes']})")

    # Generate a summarized version of the changes
    changes_summary = summarize_changes(diff_output, max_context_lines=3, max_files=10, max_file_kb=5)
    logger.info(f"Changes summary generated: {changes_summary['summary']}")

    # Rest of the function remains similar...

    # Modify the response to include both diff and summary
    response: ResponseDict = {
        "success": success,
        "diff": final_diff_content,
        "changes_summary": changes_summary,
        "file_status": file_status,
        "is_cached_diff": is_cached_diff,
    }

    if success:
        logger.info("Changes found. Processing successful.")
    else:
        logger.warning("No changes detected. Processing marked as unsuccessful.")

    logger.info("Coder results processed.")
    return response
```

### 2. Modify code_with_aider to include summary_only parameter:

```python
async def code_with_aider(
    ai_coding_prompt: str,
    relative_editable_files: List[str],
    relative_readonly_files: Optional[List[str]] = None,
    model: str = "gemini/gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17",
    working_dir: Optional[str] = None,
    use_diff_cache: bool = True,
    clear_cached_for_unchanged: bool = True,
    architect_mode: bool = False,
    editor_model: Optional[str] = None,
    auto_accept_architect: bool = True,
    summary_only: bool = False,  # Add new parameter
) -> str:
    """
    Run Aider to perform AI coding tasks based on the provided prompt and files.

    Args:
        ...existing params...
        summary_only: If True, only include the changes summary in the response, not the full diff.
                     This reduces token usage significantly.
    """
    # ...existing code...

    try:
        # Execute with retry logic
        response: ResponseDict = await _execute_with_retry(
            ai_coding_prompt,
            relative_editable_files,
            abs_editable_files,
            abs_readonly_files,
            working_dir,
            model,
            provider,
            use_diff_cache,
            clear_cached_for_unchanged,
            architect_mode,
            editor_model,
            auto_accept_architect,
            summary_only,  # Pass the new parameter
        )
    except TypeError as te:
        # ... error handling ...
    except Exception as e:
        # ... error handling ...
    finally:
        # ... cleanup ...

    # If summary_only is True, replace diff with summary
    if summary_only and "changes_summary" in response:
        # Keep the full summary in the response
        response["diff"] = json.dumps(response["changes_summary"], indent=2)

    # Convert the response to a proper JSON string
    formatted_response = json.dumps(response, indent=4)
    logger.info(f"code_with_aider process completed. Success: {response['success']}")
    return formatted_response
```

### 3. Update server.py to include the new parameter:

```python
AIDER_AI_CODE_TOOL = Tool(
    name="aider_ai_code",
    description="Run Aider to perform AI coding tasks based on the provided prompt and files",
    inputSchema={
        "type": "object",
        "properties": {
            # Existing properties
            "ai_coding_prompt": {
                "type": "string",
                "description": "The prompt for the AI to execute",
            },
            "relative_editable_files": {
                "type": "array",
                "description": "LIST of relative paths to files that can be edited",
                "items": {"type": "string"},
            },
            "relative_readonly_files": {
                "type": "array",
                "description": "LIST of relative paths to files that can be read but not edited",
                "items": {"type": "string"},
            },
            "model": {
                "type": "string",
                "description": "The primary AI model Aider should use for generating code",
            },
            # Add new parameter
            "summary_only": {
                "type": "boolean",
                "description": "If true, only return a summary of changes instead of full diff (reduces token usage)",
                "default": False
            }
        },
        "required": ["ai_coding_prompt", "relative_editable_files"],
    },
)
```

## Benefits of this Approach

1. **Reliability**: Detects file changes even when git diff or content checks alone fail
2. **Token Efficiency**: Provides a concise summary option instead of full diffs
3. **Better Information**: Gives structured, meaningful information about changes
4. **Backward Compatibility**: Maintains the existing diff field for compatibility

## Implementation Notes

1. The changes_summarizer.py module is entirely new and can be tested separately
2. The modifications to aider_ai_code.py are mostly additive, minimizing regression risks
3. Adding the summary_only parameter is optional - the system works without it but provides additional token efficiency when used

## Known Issues and Technical Debt

There are several issues that still need to be addressed in a future refactoring:

1. **Complex Functions**: Several functions have high complexity (C901 warnings):
   - _process_coder_results
   - _run_aider_session
   - code_with_aider
   - _summarize_git_diff
   - _summarize_file_contents
   - get_file_status_summary
   
   These functions should be refactored into smaller, more focused components.

2. **Type Issues**: There are still some type checking issues in aider_ai_code.py:
   - Potential None operations (attempting to call append, remove on objects that might be None)
   - Dictionary key assignments with incompatible types
   - Name redefinitions
   
   A thorough type system review and consistent typing is needed throughout the codebase.

3. **Error Handling**: Error handling is inconsistent across the codebase. A more uniform approach would improve reliability.

4. **Test Coverage**: More comprehensive tests are needed, especially for error conditions and edge cases.

These issues should be addressed in a separate refactoring task to maintain the stability of the current implementation while improving code quality.
