# Bug Fix: Resolving the RuntimeWarning in Python's Module Execution

## Problem Description

When running `aider_mcp_server` via Python's `-m` flag (e.g., `python -m aider_mcp_server`), the following RuntimeWarning was displayed:

```
RuntimeWarning: 'aider_mcp_server.__main__' found in sys.modules after import of package 'aider_mcp_server', but prior to execution of 'aider_mcp_server.__main__'
```

This warning occurs due to how Python's module system handles imports when a package's `__main__.py` module is executed using the `-m` flag. The warning indicates a potential issue with circular imports that could lead to unpredictable behavior.

## Explanation of the Issue

The warning happens because:

1. When Python runs a module with the `-m` flag, the `runpy._run_module_as_main()` function is used.
2. This function first imports the module namespace, running its `__init__.py`.
3. Then it attempts to execute `__main__.py` in the package.
4. If `__main__.py` imports other modules from the package that were already imported during step 2, or if there are mutual circular imports between modules, the warning is triggered.

## Solution Implemented

The issue was addressed by restructuring the package in several ways:

1. **Removed Circular Import**: Modified `__init__.py` to not import from `__main__.py`:

```python
# Before:
from .__main__ import main as main

# After:
# We don't import main from __main__ to avoid circular imports
# and prevent the RuntimeWarning about __main__ being in sys.modules
```

2. **Updated Package API**: Removed 'main' from `__all__` list in `__init__.py`:

```python
# Before:
__all__ = [
    "main",
    "serve_sse",
    # ...
]

# After:
__all__ = [
    # "main" is removed to avoid circular imports
    "serve_sse",
    # ...
]
```

3. **Created Dedicated Module**: Moved all CLI functionality to a separate `cli.py` module, which contains all the logic previously found in `__main__.py`.

4. **Simplified Entry Point**: Restructured `__main__.py` to be minimal and clean:

```python
"""Main entry point for the Aider MCP Server."""

# Import standard library modules first
import sys

# Import the main function from a separate module
# to avoid the circular import issues that trigger the RuntimeWarning
from aider_mcp_server.cli import main

# This creates a clean entry point for the package when run with python -m
if __name__ == "__main__":
    sys.exit(main())
```

5. **Updated Tests**: Modified all test files to use `cli.py` instead of `__main__.py` to avoid circular imports in the test suite.

## Outcome and Limitations

**Success**: The package can now be imported without circular import warnings:
```bash
python -c 'import aider_mcp_server; print("Successfully imported without warnings")'
```

**Entry Point Consideration**: While we moved the implementation to `cli.py`, we still need to expose the `main` function in `__init__.py` to support entry points defined in `setup.py`. This is critical for commands like `mcp-aider-server` to work correctly.

**Limitation**: The warning still appears when running with `python -m aider_mcp_server`. This appears to be a known issue with Python's module execution system (runpy) that can happen even with best practices in place. The warning does not affect functionality and would require more complex changes to fully eliminate.

## Benefits of this Solution

1. **Clean Architecture**: By separating CLI functionality into its own module, we've improved the package structure.
2. **Reduced Circular Imports**: The package no longer has circular import patterns when imported normally.
3. **Better Maintainability**: Code is now better organized with clearer responsibility boundaries.
4. **Improved Error Handling**: Proper use of `sys.exit()` ensures command-line exit codes are handled correctly.

## Further Testing and Analysis

Our tests now target the `cli.py` module directly rather than testing through `__main__.py`, which is more appropriate as `__main__.py` should be a minimal entry point, not the location of actual implementation logic.

Despite the remaining warning during `-m` execution, the solution follows Python's best practices for package structure and avoids the actual problems associated with circular imports.
