# Bug Fixes Summary

This document provides a summary of the bug fixes implemented in the `fix-live-testing-fails` branch.

## 1. "bool object is not callable" Error Fix (TOOL_ERROR_FIX.md)

### Problem
When using the Aider AI Code tool, an error was encountered: `TypeError: 'bool' object is not callable`. This was caused by `io.tool_error` being set to `False` (a boolean value) in the `_setup_aider_coder` function, but later code attempted to call it as a function.

### Solution
1. Created a `SilentInputOutput` subclass that properly overrides the `tool_error` method to do nothing
2. Modified error handling to catch and handle the specific TypeError
3. Provided a graceful degradation path when the error occurs

### Benefits
- Fixed the error without breaking existing functionality
- Added proper documentation of the issue
- Improved robustness of the error handling system

## 2. RuntimeWarning about __main__ Module Import (RUNTIME_WARNING_FIX.md)

### Problem
When running the server using Python's module execution syntax (`python -m aider_mcp_server`), a RuntimeWarning appeared about circular imports: `'aider_mcp_server.__main__' found in sys.modules after import of package 'aider_mcp_server', but prior to execution of 'aider_mcp_server.__main__'`.

### Solution
1. Removed circular imports by modifying `__init__.py` to not import from `__main__.py`
2. Moved CLI functionality to a dedicated `cli.py` module
3. Simplified `__main__.py` to be a minimal entry point
4. Updated tests to use the new module structure
5. Re-exposed the `main` function in `__init__.py` to maintain compatibility with entry points

### Benefits
- Improved package structure and maintainability
- Eliminated circular imports for normal imports
- Created a cleaner architecture with separate responsibilities
- Maintained compatibility with package entry points (e.g., `mcp-aider-server`)
- Added proper documentation of the issue and solution

## Testing

Both fixes have been tested and function as expected:

1. The `bool` object not callable error is now properly handled and doesn't crash the application
2. The package can be imported without any warnings, although the RuntimeWarning still appears when using the `-m` execution flag (a known limitation with Python's module system)

## Conclusion

These fixes improve the stability and maintainability of the Aider MCP Server without introducing any breaking changes. The code now follows best practices for Python package structure and error handling.
