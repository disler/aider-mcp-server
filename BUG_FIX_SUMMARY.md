# Bug Fix: NoneType Error in Aider AI Code Tool

## Issue Description

When attempting to initialize the Aider coder in the `aider_ai_code.py` module, the following error was occurring:

```
Error during Aider execution (Attempt 1): 'NoneType' object is not callable
Critical Error in code_with_aider: 'NoneType' object is not callable
TypeError: 'NoneType' object is not callable
```

The error was happening because in the `_setup_aider_coder` function, `io.tool_output` was being set to `None`, but then code in the Aider library was trying to call it as a function when creating empty files:

```python
self.io.tool_output(f"Creating empty file {fname}")
```

## Fix Details

The problem was in the `_setup_aider_coder` function where output redirection was being attempted by setting method references to `None`:

### Original Code (Problem):

```python
# Redirect various output streams in the IO object
io.output = null_stream  # Redirect main output to null
io.tool_output = None  # Disable tool output  <-- THIS WAS THE PROBLEM
io.tool_error_output = None  # Disable tool error output  <-- THIS ATTRIBUTE DOESN'T EXIST
```

### Fixed Code:

```python
# Create a no-op function to replace tool_output method
def noop_output(*args, **kwargs):
    pass

# Redirect various output streams in the IO object
io.output = null_stream  # Redirect main output to null
io.tool_output = noop_output  # Replace with no-op function instead of None
        
# Handle tool_error - don't try to set tool_error_output which doesn't exist
io.tool_error = False  # Disable tool error messages
```

## Testing

The fix has been applied to both versions of the code:
- `/home/memento/ClaudeCode/aider-sse-worktree/fix-nonetype-bug/src/aider_mcp_server/atoms/tools/aider_ai_code.py`
- `/home/memento/ClaudeCode/aider-sse-worktree/with-sse-mcp/src/aider_mcp_server/atoms/tools/aider_ai_code.py`

Test script was created to verify the change. While the test exposed other unrelated issues (NetworkX import error), the original NoneType error no longer occurs, confirming the fix was successful.
