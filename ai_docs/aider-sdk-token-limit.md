  Aider MCP Server: Token Limit Handling and Update Strategy

  1. Current Token Limit Handling in Aider SDK

  Based on analysis of the aider codebase (v0.82.3), the official aider SDK implements sophisticated token limit handling through
  several mechanisms:

  1. Token Counting and Tracking
    - Uses litellm.token_counter() to estimate token usage
    - Maintains a model-specific token count system that adapts to different providers
    - Monitors both input and output tokens
    - Reports token usage statistics to users
  2. Context Window Management
    - Implements a check_tokens() method that verifies if messages will fit within model limits
    - Shows warnings when approaching context limits
    - Offers options to proceed or abort
  3. Chat History Management
    - Uses a summarizer to reduce history token usage
    - Implements background summarization thread for performance
    - Sets max_chat_history_tokens dynamically based on model's context window
  4. Error Handling
    - Detects specific token-related errors
    - Provides user-friendly messages for context window and output token limits
    - Suggests specific actions users can take to resolve token issues
  5. Model Fallback System
    - Falls back to smaller models when necessary
    - Supports fallback configurations specific to each provider
    - Implements retry mechanism with exponential backoff

  2. Current Token Limit Handling in Aider MCP Server

  The aider MCP server has implemented some token handling features but lacks comprehensive management:

  1. Rate Limit Fallback System
    - Detects rate limit errors from providers like OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini
    - Implements backoff and retry logic
    - Falls back to smaller models when needed
  2. Diff Cache Mechanism
    - Uses a caching system for diffs to reduce repeated content
    - Implements memory limits and LRU eviction
    - Reduces tokens by storing only changes
  3. Error Handling
    - Catches rate limit errors from providers
    - Reports errors back to users
  4. Missing Features
    - No token counting/estimation before sending to models
    - No proactive content truncation or filtering
    - No intelligent code-aware content reduction
    - No explicit handling of token limit errors (vs. rate limit errors)

  3. Recommendations for Improving Token Limit Handling

  The MCP server already has a comprehensive improvement plan documented in /with-sse-mcp/ai_docs/token-limit-handling.md which
  includes:

  1. Token Counting and Estimation
    - Implement character-based token estimation
    - Adapt estimation based on model provider
  2. Token Budget Management
    - Create a TokenBudgetManager class to track and manage token usage
    - Implement methods to check if content fits within budget
  3. Smart File Selection
    - Implement relevance-based file selection
    - Prioritize files within token budget
  4. Content Reduction for Large Files
    - Add file content reduction strategies
    - Preserve important code elements like imports and signatures
    - Implement intelligent truncation for different file types
  5. Token-Specific Error Handling
    - Add specific handling for token limit errors
    - Provide user-friendly suggestions based on error type and model
  6. Enhanced aider_ai_code Implementation
    - Add token management to code_with_aider function
    - Implement automatic content reduction
    - Add configuration options for token management

  4. Staying Up-to-Date with Aider Updates

  The aider MCP server is dependent on the aider-chat package, which is specified in pyproject.toml. To stay up-to-date:

  1. Version Pinning Strategy
    - Current dependency is specified as aider-chat>=0.81.0
    - Consider using a more specific version range to prevent breaking changes
    - Example: aider-chat>=0.82.0,<0.83.0
  2. Monitoring for Updates
    - Set up GitHub watches/notifications for the https://github.com/Aider-AI/aider
    - Subscribe to releases via RSS feed
    - Implement CI pipeline to check for new versions
  3. Testing New Releases
    - Create a test procedure to validate token handling with new aider releases
    - Maintain a test suite specifically for token limit scenarios
    - Test with various model providers and file sizes
  4. Documentation Updates
    - Update supporting materials in ai_docs with each major aider release
    - Maintain documentation about how aider's token handling has changed
    - Document any compatibility issues or breaking changes
  5. Dependency Management
    - Use tools like dependabot to automatically detect new versions
    - Consider using a lockfile manager to ensure reproducible builds
    - Implement version validation during builds

  5. Implementation Priority

  Based on the findings, I recommend the following implementation priorities:

  1. First Phase (Immediate)
    - Implement basic token counting and estimation
    - Add logging for token usage
    - Track token-related errors
  2. Second Phase (Near-term)
    - Implement TokenBudgetManager
    - Add configuration options for token limits
    - Add basic content reduction
  3. Third Phase (Medium-term)
    - Implement relevance-based file selection
    - Add enhanced error messages
    - Create progressive degradation strategies
  4. Fourth Phase (Long-term)
    - Add user-facing warnings
    - Provide detailed CLI configuration
    - Create comprehensive documentation

  6. Conclusion

  The aider MCP server has a solid foundation for token handling through its rate limit and diff cache systems. By implementing the
  proposed improvements from the token-limit-handling.md document and establishing a robust update strategy, the server will be better
  equipped to handle large codebases efficiently.

  Regular monitoring of the aider GitHub releases page and automated dependency checks will ensure that the MCP server stays up-to-date
   with the latest token handling improvements from the core aider project.
