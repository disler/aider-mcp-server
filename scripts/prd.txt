# Product Requirements Document: Multi-Client HTTP Streamable Server Architecture

## Project Overview

**Project Name**: Multi-Client HTTP Streamable Server Architecture
**Version**: 2.0
**Target Release**: Feature branch completion
**Project Type**: MCP-compliant multi-client architecture implementation

## Executive Summary

Implement a multi-client HTTP server architecture for the Aider MCP Server that provides true client isolation and concurrent operations. This enhancement transforms the existing single-client HTTP transport into a scalable, MCP-compliant multi-client system where each Claude Code instance gets a dedicated server process with isolated workspace, port, and state.

## Business Objectives

### Primary Goals
1. **MCP Compliance**: Implement proper 1:1 client-server relationships per MCP specification
2. **Client Isolation**: Complete separation of clients (workspace, process, port, state)
3. **Concurrent Operations**: Support multiple Claude Code instances simultaneously
4. **Scalability**: Dynamic server instance management with resource allocation
5. **Security**: Enforce security boundaries between different client sessions

### Success Criteria
- Multiple Claude Code instances can connect concurrently without interference
- Each client gets dedicated server instance with unique port (8000-9000 range)
- Complete workspace isolation (separate git repositories, working directories)
- Zero cross-client data contamination or state sharing
- MCP-compliant session management and lifecycle handling
- Graceful server instance spawning and cleanup
- Discovery mechanism for client-to-server connection establishment

## Technical Context

### Current Architecture Analysis
- **Existing HTTP Transport**: `HttpStreamableTransportAdapter` supports single client only
- **Shared State Problem**: ApplicationCoordinator singleton broadcasts to ALL clients
- **Port Conflicts**: Static port allocation prevents multiple instances
- **Workspace Contamination**: Single working directory shared across clients

### MCP Architecture Requirements (Validated via Research)
- **1:1 Connection Model**: Each MCP client maintains exactly one connection with one server instance
- **Stateful Sessions**: Each client-server pair maintains its own session state
- **Session Isolation**: Full conversation history and context stays with the host
- **Security Boundaries**: Clients maintain security boundaries between different servers

### Research Findings
✅ **MCP Protocol Fundamentals**: Supports multiple clients connecting to different server instances
✅ **Transport Support**: HTTP with streamable endpoints is the recommended modern approach
✅ **Claude Code Integration**: Supports multiple MCP server connections simultaneously
✅ **Port Management**: Dynamic port allocation with discovery is standard pattern
✅ **Architecture Validation**: Dedicated server instances per client is MCP-compliant and recommended
